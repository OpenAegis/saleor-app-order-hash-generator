# Saleor App Hono Deno Example

A lightweight Saleor app template leveraging Hono's ultrafast routing capabilities (under 14kB) and Deno for runtime and deployment.

> [!CAUTION]
> This example uses unreleased features of `@saleor/app-sdk`

## Demo

Explore the live demo at [saleor-app-hono-deno.deno.dev](https://saleor-app-hono-deno.deno.dev/).

## Overview

This template provides a foundation for building Saleor apps using the Hono framework and Deno, featuring:

- **Backend**: Hono-powered API routes for Saleor integration.
- **Frontend**: A Single Page Application (SPA) built with React, served at the `/app` route, and rendered within the Saleor Dashboard.
- **Storage**: Deno KV as the Auth Persistence Layer (APL).

## How It Works

1. **Frontend SPA**: 
   - The SPA is built using Vite and React. It is located in the `client/` directory.
   - The built files are output to the `server/dist/` directory.
   - The SPA is served at the `/app` route by Hono and displayed within the Saleor Dashboard after installing the app.

2. **Backend API**:
   - Hono serves as the backend framework, providing routes for API endpoints, webhooks, and static assets.
   - The backend handles app registration with Saleor, webhook processing, and authentication using a custom Deno KV-based APL implementation.

```

## Prerequisites

- [Deno](https://deno.land/) (latest version recommended)
- A running Saleor instance

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/witoszekdev/saleor-app-hono-deno-template.git
   cd saleor-app-hono-deno-template
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   deno install
   ```

3. Fetch the Saleor GraphQL schema:

> [!NOTE]
> This command has to be run either through `pnpm` or `npm` because it relies on specific package.json feature for getting Saleor schema version

   ```bash
   pnpm run fetch-schema
   # or
   npm run fetch-schema
   ```

4. Generate TypeScript types from the schema:
   ```bash
   deno task generate
   ```

## Development

You can run the project using:

```bash
deno task serve
```

it does 2 things:
1. Builds the frontend SPA using Vite (`deno task build`) to `server/dist` directory
2. Starts the Deno server in watch mode (`deno task server:start`)

After running the task app will be available at `http://localhost:3000` and will reload on each change in server code.

> ![WARN]
> Server will not reload after changes in `client` code, for that you need to run command
>
> ```bash
> deno task build
> ```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Set up environment variables as needed:

- `APL`: Set to `deno` to use Deno KV-based APL.
- Other sensitive data like API keys should be managed securely using Deno's environment management.

### Customizing Routes

The SPA is served at `/app`, but you can modify this route in `server/main.tsx`. Update the `serveStatic` configuration as needed and `api/manifest` implementation.

## Deployment

You can deploy this app using any platform that supports Deno:

1. **Deno Deploy**:
   - Push your code to a GitHub repository.
   - Connect your repository to [Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy).
   - Use following settings when setting up project:
      - **Install step**: `deno install`
      - **Build step**: `deno task build`
      - **Entry Point**: `server/main.tsx`
      - **Env variables**:
        - `APL`: `deno`

2. **Self-hosted Deployment**:
   - Run on your server:
     ```bash
     deno run --allow-net --allow-read --allow-env --unstable-kv server/main.tsx
     ```

3. **Docker Deployment** (optional):
   - Create a Dockerfile with Deno support and deploy it to your preferred cloud provider.

### Query Order Status by Hash

```
GET /api/order-status/{hash}
```

Returns the actual status and payment status of the order associated with the provided hash.

Example response:
```json
{
  "hash": "abcdef123456...",
  "orderId": "T3JkZXI6MQ==",
  "status": "FULFILLED",
  "orderNumber": "12345",
  "paymentStatus": "FULLY_CHARGED",
  "isPaid": true
}
```

```
GET /api/order-status/{hash}/metadata
```

Returns detailed information about the order including all metadata associated with the provided hash.

Example response:
```json
{
  "hash": "abcdef123456...",
  "orderId": "T3JkZXI6MQ==",
  "order": {
    "id": "T3JkZXI6MQ==",
    "number": "12345",
    "status": "FULFILLED",
    "paymentStatus": "FULLY_CHARGED",
    "isPaid": true,
    "metadata": [
      {
        "key": "order_hash",
        "value": "abcdef123456..."
      },
      {
        "key": "custom_field",
        "value": "custom_value"
      }
    ],
    "privateMetadata": [
      {
        "key": "internal_note",
        "value": "This is an internal note"
      }
    ],
    "created": "2023-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "updated": "2023-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "userEmail": "customer@example.com"
  },
  "status": "found"
}
```
